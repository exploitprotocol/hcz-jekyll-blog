# Appie Version 3 Released

So it has been more than a year since [Appie](https://manifestsecurity.com/appie/) was launched, and i have been receiving awesome response from it's users since then. Thanks a ton for that :)

Below are some of changes which have been made from previous version:- 

  * It now have Python 32 bit so that even 32 bit systems have no problem with usage.
  * Also updated the Conemu framework which i use as a base terminal.
  * Although all the tools are now updated in Appie, but in this version i have introduced a simple update script through which you can update all the tools inside Appie without downloading new version of Appie. So at the end this saves your lot of time. 
  * It is lot more faster now, if you are an existing user of Appie than you will notice that.
  * Some new tools have been included in this version:- 
    * I have replaced Sublime Text with open-source [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor.
    * [ByteCodeViewer](http://bytecodeviewer.com/)
    * [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)
    * [SQLite Database Browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
    * [SQLmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap)
    * Included Mozilla Firefox with [some security addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/pentestbox/pentestbox-addons-collection/).
    * [AndroBugs Framework](https://github.com/AndroBugs/AndroBugs_Framework)
    * And finally Appie has a logo. ![](https://i.imgur.com/3B3uKjA.png)

### Using Update Feature

Using update feature is very simple, currently there are only two options in update script.

Type **update** in Appie terminal.

With **update tools**, all tools will get updated inside Appie and with **update config**, appie configuration files will get updated.
