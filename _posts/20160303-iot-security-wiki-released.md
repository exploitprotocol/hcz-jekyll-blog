# IoT Security Wiki Released

Hi !

From last 2-3 months i have been working on some projects related to IoT Security. As there are very less people in IoT Security, it was very difficult to find any resources and learn about it. Nearly one year ago i released [MobileSecurityWiki](https://mobilesecuritywiki.com) and i got some awesome feedbacks about it from the community members. So i thought to release the same for IoT, but doing that is very difficult task, because there are too many things in IoT and there are different kind of IoT devices. Current version mostly contains research/presentations/talks/studies. 

I look forward for your additions/suggestion/feedback for this wiki. Please visit the [wiki](https://iotsecuritywiki.com) to know procedure to suggest additions. I think this would be very helpful for the developers and security researchers in the long run. 

Thanks

Aditya Agrawal
