# [Pentester Academy] Web Application Security Challenge 17

First i tried to insert "><h1>@exploitprotocol</h1><xss input=" in Email and password but it was stripping the value's so i thought to comment out remaining portion.  
so i inserted Email- "><h1>Vunerable<!--  
                   Password- \-->to+HTMLi<!--  
and it worked.
