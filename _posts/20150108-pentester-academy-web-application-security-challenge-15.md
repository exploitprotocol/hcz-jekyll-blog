# [Pentester Academy] Web Application Security Challenge 15

This challenge is almost like the last one .In this also there are 4 parts of the file with w,c,x,b as there name instead of xaa,xab,xac,xad in the case of last one.But i do not know in what order i should concatenate them and what would be the output file.So after lot of researching over the internet i came to conclusion that these are the parts of an image file. so i saved the files as image.w,image.c,image.x,image.b then concatenated in to an .jpg file ![](https://i.imgur.com/Dh3niNw.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/5NqsSar.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/dFmP0Pt.png)
