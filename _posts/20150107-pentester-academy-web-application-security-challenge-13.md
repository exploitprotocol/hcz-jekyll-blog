First I downloaded the pcap file the using tcpxtract i extracted all the files from pass.pcap file  
What i found is a 00000018.zip file which is password protected.  
To crack that file i wrote an python script to create all possible combination of password's  
  
It will Create a password.txt file ....  
Now cracking 00000018.zip file using fcrackzip tool  
Â fcrackzip -D -p password.txt -u 00000018.zip  
Password for the file is abc132
