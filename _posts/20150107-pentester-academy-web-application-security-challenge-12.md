First I Downloaded the file from the Challenge Page...  
then i unzipped https.zip file using command - unzip https.zip ...  
then we can see that there are three files apache.key,apache.crt,https-sid.pcap  
below is snapshot of file when opened in wireshark...as you can that all transaction are over SSL.....  
so now i will create a apche.pem using command- cat apache.key apache.crt > apache.pem  
now apache.pem file can be used to decrypt the traffic  
now go to Edit>Prefrences>Protocols>SSL  
Now add a new RSA key list with field's as given below
