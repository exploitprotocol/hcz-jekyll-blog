# Install Google Play Store in Genymotion

In this post i will demonstrate how you can install **Google Play Store** in a Genymotion Device.

  * Switch ON your Genymotion Device. 
  * Download Google Apps from [Cynogenmod](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Google_Apps#gappsCM11)
  * Drag and Drop the downloaded zip file to Genymotion Device. It will ask for confirmation,confirm it.Then it will start showing some error's, ignore for the time being and follow the next steps without opening any installed apps now.
