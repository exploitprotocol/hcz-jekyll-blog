# Configuring your Device for Pentesting

In the [First Part](https://manifestsecurity.com/android-application-security-part-1) of the series i have shown how we can configure a virtual device for pentesting. In this post i will demonstrate how you can actually configure your real device(phone/tablet/smart watch) for pentesting.

  * Tap on the build number until it says " You are now a developer" ![](https://i.imgur.com/Fhu598E.jpg)

  * Go to the Developer Options. ![](https://i.imgur.com/isjuOIR.jpg)

  * Tap on **USB Debugging** . ![](https://i.imgur.com/Oencx7m.jpg)

  * Connect your Phone with the USB cable and you will see this notification on your Screen .

  * Now you can also install Drozer agent on your phone or can also get a shell. Note you will be prompted on your phone while connecting using adb.
