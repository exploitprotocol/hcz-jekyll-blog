# [Pentester Academy] Web Application Security Challenge 25

This is one of the interesting XSS challenge . In this challenge the motive was to learn that the filename field can also not sanitized which could lead to XSS attacks. For this you can create a file in a UNIX environment with an XSS vector in it's name like **<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>.jpg** Or also can intercept the request and change the file name field and conclude that following field is vulnerable. ![](https://i.imgur.com/uRoWgW9.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/O89m6VB.png)
