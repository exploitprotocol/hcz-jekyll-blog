# Install Google Play Store in Genymotion

Hello Everyone, In this post i will be describing how to install Google play store in the Genymotion Device.I'm installing Google play store to make other apps install through it .We can also install apps through adb(Android Debug Bridge) but for that we need an .apk file with us. Let's start counting steps :) (1) Switch ON your Genymotion Device. (2) Download Google Apps from [Cynogenmod]() (3) Drag and Drop the downloaded zip file to Genymotion Device.It will ask for confirmation,confirm it.Then it will start showing some error's ,ignore for the time being and follow the next steps without opening any installed apps now. (4) Go to Settings.
